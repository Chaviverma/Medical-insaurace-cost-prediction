# Medical-insaurace-cost-prediction
Medical Insurance Cost Prediction is a machine learning project that predicts health insurance charges based on personal factors such as age, gender, BMI, number of children, smoking habits, and region. By analyzing these inputs, the model helps estimate the expected premium, giving users an idea of their potential medical insurance costs.
